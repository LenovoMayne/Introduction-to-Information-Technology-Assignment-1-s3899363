<p style="color:grey;background-color:violet;font-family:arial">Background Information: I was born in Australia; however, my dad is a second-generation Italian. I finished VCE at Whitefriars College last year. I speak English and a little bit of Indonesian. An interesting fact about me is that literally none of my mates thought I’d do IT at university. </p>

<h1 style="color:violet;font-family:arial">Interest in IT:</h1>
<p style="color:grey;background-color:violet;font-family:arial">I have always been extremely interested in IT from a young age. I love to tinker with computers and troubleshoot the classic family IT dilemma. I believe my interest in IT started when I found out that my uncle had his Masters in Computer Science from RMIT, to be honest that’s the whole reason I wanted to come to RMIT to begin with. In terms of experience, I did Unit 1 and 2 Computing in Year 11 and then on to Unit 3 and 4 Software Development in Year 12. I hope to gain valuable skills and experience in the field during my time at RMIT so that I am ready to start a career post-university.</p>

<h1 style="color:violet;font-family:arial">Ideal Job:</h1>
<p style="color:grey;background-color:violet;font-family:arial">Manager – Cyber Security at TAFE NSW</p>
<p style="color:grey;background-color:violet;font-family:arial">Link to SEEK page <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/51755757?type=promoted#searchRequestToken=6cc1e6cd-f822-4fa0-b0e1-86558354aa9c"style="color:blue;background-color:violet;">here</a>
<p style="color:grey;background-color:violet;font-family:arial">Position description: Making sure that TAFE NSW’s compliance, legal and regulatory obligations are upheld through the implementation of cyber security techniques. This position is very appealing to me as cyber security is one of my favourite fields within computing and also the annual wage is very promising at around $200,000.</p>
<p style="color:grey;background-color:violet;font-family:arial">Experience and prerequisite description: Currently I have not met any of the requirements for this role as this position is for a more experienced individual. However, to achieve this role I will have to be CISSP accredited, at least 5 years management experience, have an understanding of the NIST framework and PCI DSS compliance for a medium to large organisation.</p>

<h1 style="color:violet;font-family:arial">Personal Profile:</h1>
<p style="color:grey;background-color:violet;font-family:arial">The results of the MBTI test resonate the most with as I believe it is the most accurate reflection of my personality. Just reading through some of the examples of what a “Mediator” sees in relationships really does sound like something I would be after in a platonic/romantic sense. In terms of working in a team, these results depict that my team skills could do with some improvement, however that I am open to try new things. I should now know my strengths and weaknesses when it comes to working as a team, that being said, I can focus on areas of teamwork that have been difficult for me in the past.</p>

<h1 style="color:violet;font-family:arial">Project Idea:</h1>
<h3 style="color:violet;font-family:arial">Description:</h3>
<p style="color:grey;background-color:violet;font-family:arial">This project idea revolves around having the ability to keep track of your spending’s throughout the day. It is a type of real-time budgeting that will allow you to keep track of what you have spent, how much you have left in total and also recommendations as to whether or not you should purchase an item or service. This can be used by anyone as it caters for various purposes. For example, if you’re having a night out this application will allow you to easily see if you can afford that next round of beer or any other expenses that may or may not occur at the club. You won’t have to franticly transfer money in the queue at the bar as this application will take care of that for you, as long as you can actually afford it. In the initial setup, the user will enter in goals and boundaries for their spending. For example, one user might choose to set a boundary for $300 on a night out and a goal for under $200 spent all up that night. The application will give you various notifications when you are approaching or have passed these goals or boundaries. The application will not prevent you from spending more money, however it will make it abundantly obvious that you should probably stop.</p>
<h3 style="color:violet;font-family:arial">Why the project is important or interesting:</h3>
<p style="color:grey;background-color:violet;font-family:arial">A lot of people find themselves in a situation where they either probably shouldn’t buy something because they’ve already spent a lot of money or they flat out can’t afford it. I hope to prevent these scenarios completely with the creation and implementation of this app. The interesting thing about this concept/idea is that the person that will benefit most from this app is probably me. Seeing as though I’m not earning that much and am still under the impression that I can go out most nights, maybe this app will make some much-needed changes surrounding my spending habits. I doubt that I’m the only one that seems to find themselves in this position a lot, so hopefully this app will help others too. Most likely using Python through Visual Studio, creating this application will not only assist in the clubbing scene, it will also be a valuable tool in daily life. Making sure that the user has enough to live day to day is the top priority for this application. Making this happen will involve initial inputs of information from the user about their expenses (i.e., bills and food). These inputs will be factored in to the equation when the app looks at how much the user earns and figures out how much the user can spend on groceries, bills and also general spending money.</p>
<h3 style="color:violet;font-family:arial">Skills and preparations required:</h3>
<p style="color:grey;background-color:violet;font-family:arial">To have a thorough understanding of Python and all of its potential uses. This will allow me to get the most out of the source code so that my programming methods are efficient and effective. There will also be a software requirements specification (SRS) that will be made before starting the initial development so that the skills and time frame are pre-determined, which should eliminate most unwanted surprises from occurring. The hardware that will be used to create this application will be my PC at home which has sufficient RAM to handle the programming section of this project, however the laptop that I’m currently using will also suffice. Within the SRS, there will be design models that will outline the overall appearance of the application, so I will have to be able to illustrate clearly and concisely my concepts for the application.</p>
<h3 style="color:violet;font-family:arial">Intended outcome:</h3>
<p style="color:grey;background-color:violet;font-family:arial">When the application is operational and is finally implemented, the ideal outcome will be as follows. Users will have more control over their earning and spending, making budgeting and saving more accessible from your phone. Another key outcome will be the fact that people will no longer have to stress abut whether or not they have money in their account in order to pay for something in the queue, this application will take care of that as it controls all of your accounts that are linked to your card which is customisable through the mobile application. Lastly, I want the app to be able to progressively learn spending patterns and possible areas of improvement for the user in terms of their spending, say if they could be spending less money for the same outcome or to offer cheaper alternatives. This feature could be implemented later on down the track; however, it is still a priority of mine to one day make this a part of the application.</p>
<h3 style="color:violet;font-family:arial">Potential drawbacks or obstacles:</h3>
<p style="color:grey;background-color:violet;font-family:arial">The main drawback or obstacle that I can see being a potential major issue is the feasibility of this project idea. Not saying that it impossible, however with the limited skills that I have at the moment, undertaking a project like this will prove to be extremely challenging. However, if it can be pulled off, it will be quite rewarding knowing how difficult this may become further down the track. Another slight obstacle me be the communication between the user’s bank and the application itself. I’m sure to gain access to an individual’s bank details through the bank itself may seem insurmountable, however I believe it is worth a try seeing as though this application with (hopefully) convenience its users to the point were the trouble of actually granting access to their bank is worth the hassle.</p>
